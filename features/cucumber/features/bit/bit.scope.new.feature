Feature: I can add a bit remote scopes

  Scenario: Add remote scope
    Given a file named "~/.takelage.yml" with:
      """
      ---
      bit_remote: 'ssh://bit@bitboard-cucumber:222:/bit'
      bit_ssh: 'ssh -F $HOME/.ssh/config -p 222 bit@bitboard-cucumber'
      """
    And I get the active takeltau config
    And the list of remote scopes is up-to-date
    And a remote scope named "my_scope" should not exist
    When I successfully run `tau-cli bit scope new my_scope`
    Then the list of remote scopes is up-to-date
    And the remote scope "my_scope" should exist
